# codmetric_Caesar-Cipher-Encryption-Tool
A simple Python GUI app for Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption. Users can input text, choose a shift value, and toggle between encrypt/decrypt modes. Built with Tkinter, it demonstrates basic cryptography concepts in a clean, user-friendly interface. Part of CodMetric internship.

# 🛡️ Caesar Cipher Encryption Tool

A simple yet effective Python GUI app to encrypt and decrypt messages using the **Caesar Cipher** technique. Built as part of my **Cybersecurity Internship at CodMetric**, this project demonstrates the fundamentals of classical cryptography in a clean and intuitive way.

🧠 About the Caesar Cipher
The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. Each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.

Example (Shift = 3):
HELLO → KHOOR
